### Announcements

- On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Sunday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it counts for 10% of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for a couple of reasons:

	1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
	1. You only get one attempt at re-taking it if you do not pass the first time.

- An exam score of 80% or greater is required to pass the exam. Note that the final exam category in your course average is pass/fail: a score of 80% or greater gets you 100% of the points in that category. Thus, passing the exam will bump up your course average a bit.
- Do note, though, that you can (and definitely should!!!) still be resourceful and use books, Google, a REPL, whatever, to answer the questions. The exam is open-book. Life is open-book.
- Your quizzes are designed to help you prepare, so be sure to review them before the exam.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 13 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to understand concepts in persistence and the JavaScript commands needed to read/write to/from local storage, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate knowledge and command of JSON syntax and structure, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.

## Readings

## Discussion on Final Projects

- Look at responses (so far) to the project ideas discussion in Canvas
- Overview of project assignment specifications
- Discuss process for selecting projects and setting teams
- FAQ
  - **Are all of the requirements firm?** (No, there is room for negotiation, but variances must be pre-approved)
  - **Can teams use API data?** (Generally no, there are ways to mock that up more in line with our collective technical command at this point. That's covered extensively in 301.)
  - **What can teams use outside of the good ole HTML, CSS, JS, etc.? Are there any approved libraries?** (It's easier to name the excluded libraries: jQuery, any CSS libraries/frameworks such as Bootstrap or Skeleton. It's OK to use other libraries or utilities like ChartJS, for instance, but we'll discuss them individually with each team as part of reviewing your project plan.)

## UI & UX discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.

- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/)
- [10 Web design trends you can expect to see on websites in 2015](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/01/02/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2015/)
- [40 Stunning Website Designs with Great Color Schemes](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/10/25/40-stunning-website-designs-with-great-color-schemes/)
- [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
- [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/)
- [Seattle Times project on the Ehlwa River](https://github.com/seattletimes/elwha)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful. Find a design or layout you like and build something that mimics it. ALWAYS try to view your project from the perspective of someone who has never seen it before. Does the user need instructions? Are the user interactions clear to a new user?
